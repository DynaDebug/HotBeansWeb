        <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Hot beans originated from a splinter in the workforce and management of the google chrome team in 2008. This means we came with massive amounts of experience, we decided to collaberate with each other to create web pages for other companies and make hot beans a reality.(If anyone is wondering the name comes from Andrews favorite food, baked beans).</p><br>

        <h2>Our values</h2>
        <ul> <b>
        We are committed to a healthy world and we are proud to say that we are 100% powered by sustainable energy.<br>
        We are commited to a respectful workplace without the ties to discrimination or misconduct that other companies thrive on.<br>
        We are a worker owned orgination, although we tend to work for big companies they do not have any say in how we are run. Our supervisors are chosen by the rest of the team in a vote which can be revoked at any time. Half of the profits from each job goes to all workers that participated in the project according to how much they contrubuted to the work completed. <br> 
        We are commited to the training of young workers with our apprenticeship program.<br>
        We do not hire based on experience but on feel of the applicants value and willingness to work, for this reason we have a interview for all applicants. <br>
    </b></ul><Br><br><Br><br><Br><br><Br>
        
        <h2>What have we become?</h2>
        <p>Since 2008, we have moved from andrews garage into a full studio for our team to use and complete up to 2 projects at once. Our brand name (while not exactly household) is well known in the industry and allows us to put ourselves out there to get exponentially more jobs. However of these jobs we tend to only be able to do 1 at a time due to a lack of staff, not even being able to use the second room of our studio. If you looked at all this and decided that you wanted to sign up for a job here then you have our gratitude and promise that we will review the your application fairly. Application can be found <a href="Application form.html">here</a>.  </p>
